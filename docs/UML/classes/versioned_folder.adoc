h|*Description*
2+a|A version-controlled hierarchy of `FOLDERs` giving the effect of a directory.

NOTE: It is strongly recommended that the inherited attribute `_uid_` be populated in top-level (i.e. tree-root) `FOLDER` objects, using the UID copied from the `_object_id()_` of the `_uid_` field of the enclosing `VERSION` object. +
For example, the `ORIGINAL_VERSION.uid` `87284370-2D4B-4e3d-A3F3-F303D2F4F34B::uk.nhs.ehr1::2`  would be copied to the `_uid_` field of the top `FOLDER` object.
