h|*Class*
2+^h|*_PARTY (abstract)_*

h|*Description*
2+a|Ancestor of all Party types, including real world entities and their roles. A Party is any entity which can participate in an activity. The `_name_` attribute inherited from `LOCATABLE` is used to indicate the actual type of party (note that the actual names, i.e. identities of parties are indicated in the `_identities_` attribute, not the `_name_` attribute).

NOTE: It is strongly recommended that the inherited attribute `_uid_` be populated in `PARTY` objects, using the UID copied from the `_object_id()_` of the `_uid_` field of the enclosing `VERSION` object. +
For example, the `ORIGINAL_VERSION.uid` `87284370-2D4B-4e3d-A3F3-F303D2F4F34B::uk.nhs.ehr1::2`  would be copied to the `_uid_` field of the `PARTY` object.
