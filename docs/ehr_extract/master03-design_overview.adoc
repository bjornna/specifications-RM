= Design Overview

== Abstract Communication Model

The openEHR Extract model uses two design ideas. Firstly, the notion of a Request and an Extract
(the reply) are distinguished. Extracts may include a copy of the Request to which the Extract is a
reply, indicating what is actually in the Extract, which may differ from what was requested. Secondly,
the common semantics of Requests and Extracts are modelled in a generic way, with a number of specialised
Request and Extract types being based on the common classes. Different concrete types of
Extract are thus used to satisfy particular groups of requirements, rather than trying to make one kind
of Extract perform all possible tasks. The figure below illustrates key Extract communication scenarios,
along with the various concrete Extract types defined by the model.

The EHR Extract is just one concrete type of Extract. The other types include:

* _Generic Extract_: an Extract type designed for use with non-openEHR systems communicating to openEHR systems, and users of the {iso_13606}[ISO 13606 EHR Extract^] specification. The Generic Extract assumes the absolute minimum about what is in a system, while remaining within the openEHR type system;
* _Synchronisation Extract_: an Extract used for updating mirrored EHRs across systems; uses Contributions as the grouping concept.

Other types of Extract may be defined in the future.

The pattern of requests and replies may be controlled in time. The simplest situation is single request,
single reply. Other variants include:

* send request, persist in server, and use 'action' requests to obtain an Extract, which may
have differing content each time;
* send request indicating a repeat period, at which server automatically sends replies;
* send request indicating a trigger event on which server should send replies.

== Content Model & Representation

The general situation of any environment from which content needs to be extracted and sent to
another system is that three categories of data may be needed: the 'key' clinical and administrative
information, typically EHR content (e.g. patient blood pressure history); demographic information
(indicating who the patient and professionals are that are mentioned in the clinical information; and
relevant meta-data. These types of information almost always reside in different parts of the source
system environment, but need to be combined within the Extract. The model defined in this specification
allows for content to be flexibly aggregated in an Extract. The model therefore consists of a
generic Extract containment structure into which specific archetyped content can be plugged, with the
whole structure being templated. Each such template corresponds to one extract type, i.e. one message
type. This is visualised in the figure below.

The templates can be used to generate content in at least two ways. The default approach is to use the
template for a given extract type, say 'referral', to create standard openEHR content according to the
published openEHR EHR Extract schema (which largely re-uses the main openEHR EHR and demographic
schemas). In this approach, every Extract message conforms to the standard schema - an
XML Extract document is 'standard generic openEHR XML' in this case.

An alternative approach converts each template into its own schema, to which all instances of that
template conform. Different templates, e.g. discharge summaries and referrals define distinct schemas.
In this method, the XML of any message is specific to its own schema. If changes are required in
the message content, the schema usually has to be re-generated. The two methods are illustrated in
the following figure.

Which method is used depends on the requirements of the environment and other factors, such as the
stability of the template structures. The sections of this document describing specific kinds of extract
show details of the concrete data representations involved.

== Package Structure

The `rm.extract` package defines the semantics of Extracts from openEHR data sources, including
EHRs. The UML diagram below illustrates the package structure of the `rm.extract` package.

.rm.ehr_extract package
image::{uml_diagrams_uri}/RM-ehr_extract-packages.svg[id=rm_ehr_extract_packages, align="center"]

The sub-packages are as follows:

* `common`: semantics common to all Extracts;
* `ehr_extract`: semantics for the EHR Extract type;
* `generic_extract`: defines semantics of the Generic Extract type;
* `synchronisation_extract`: defines semantics of the Synchronisation Extract type;
* `message`: simple model of a message containing an Extract.
